## To get started

```
@pyproject.toml
We are within a devcontainer for developing this python project.
Can you try to read all the files within the workspace and understand those?
```

## To write a test file

```
Please write a test for connecting surrealdb! Ask anything if you have missing information. We need to use the latest surrealdb.py client, with the user and the password set up while starting surrealdb within the devcontainer.
